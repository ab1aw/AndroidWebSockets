# AndroidWebSockets

I have ported the WebSockets library, a pure Java library, to run in an Android environment.  The original WebSockets library, as supplied by Persistent Systems, was a pure Java library that built and executed only within a standard Linux environment.

This Android implementation of the WebSockets library is built using Android Studio.  The corresponding project files for building and running the demo application are part of this repository.
